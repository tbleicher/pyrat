All users should update to this version.

This version fixes a bug which can lead to wrong spot values being displayed for falsecolor images.

major changes:

This version adds command line support. Falsecolor2 options and new debug options ('-v' and '-d') can now be given as command line arguments following the falsecolor2 argument convention.

It also includes a new configuration file parser which will allow future versions to read configuration options set by the user. This version will create a configuration file in the user's %APPDATA% (Windows) or $HOME directory on the first startup.

further changes:

* fixed a problem with the status bar that caused an error message to pop up on close

* changed the start sequence so that the interface appears now before data is loaded or a falsecolor conversion starts

* new automatic and manual update checks  

* logging is now done via the Python logging module
